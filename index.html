<b>The TC Files - Enjin Tribute</b><br>
<i>View this at https://enjintribute.github.io/enjintribute/</i><br>
<br>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
<br>
Mineplex was created in June 2013 as a result of two servers merging. In November 2013, Mineplex added Survival Games beta and other games.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In December 2013, Mineplex partenered with CaptainSparklez and others to promote the server on YouTube. They also ran a promotion where if you created an account on the forum, you would get 5000 gems bonus, which caused Enjin to get flooded with new Mineplex users.<br>
<br>
This is the beginning of the Mineplex era.<br>
<br>
//<br>
<br><br>
In February 2014, there were more and more "tryhards" spamming the forums in an attempt to get staff. This is the beginning of the "drama", but things were mostly cool at this point. <br>
<br><br>
In June 2014, a user called Redcamle started spamming the chat on Mineplex with insults, which led to me reporting him on the forums.<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
After getting muted, he immediately started creating new accounts, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OTBeLbB.png">spamming the forums randomly</a> while buying us ranks then recording videos of himself screaming at us in Walmart, among other things. He has even lied about having cancer, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xnetBy1.png">his family dying of cancer</a>, and has <a href="https://i.imgur.com/s6jHEL1.png">created fake accounts posing as a guy with abs</a> (he is fat IRL). He also claimed he was hacking Mineplex. This has lasted for over two years. He was also <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qfSN9HG.png">switching between apologizing to us and spamming insults in all caps every few hours, then apologizing again and so on</a><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
Also in June 2014, a Twitter user named "lelddos" claimed to have DDoSed Mineplex and other popular servers. He also posted various internal files from Mineplex. He was believed to be a fraud, but as you will see later, he was actually behind the 2016 Mirai botnet attack, which led to him getting arrested.<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0b6s3yT.png" /><br>
<br>
Also around this time, a user called NiggerSex would make accounts, spam everyone's walls with disgusting images and then deactivate the account. <br>
This led to everyone locking their walls to friends only. <br>
<br>
After this, NiggerSex went as far as to create normal looking enjin accounts, added lots of people as friends, and then changing the name to NiggerSex and spamming their walls. The spam was so bad that the only thing you could do was to clear your wall of all posts instead of trying to scroll through and just delete his spam. He spammed with the worst images you could find on the internet - Gore, corpses, and other things.<br>
<br>
TSA (an Enjin group) managed to dox NiggerSex, the person behind the accounts was "Multi". He left the site forever after the dox.<br>
<br>
<br>
In August 2014, Dctr_ forum banned me and a few other people. The bans were highly controversial, as in they were 100% unfair. This led to the start of Dctr_'s hate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also around this time, Necrai (a popular user) got network banned for "Community Disruption". He was one of the first network banned people. He was banned for crashing servers by joining them with large parties, among other things.<br>
<br>
<b>This was the beginning of the Mineplex unrest.</b><br>
<br>
As of November 2014, Redcamle continued to wreck havoc on enjin, so me and another Enjin user called Aber (which I just met) decided to create a document showing everything that he's done. Thanks to this, we met many other people such as Quazamaster, Jonathan2907, etc. We got to know Aber's friends too (allio3200, Thehamp1024, pigpoof, etc).<br>
<br>
We friended each other and we started to play on Mineplex together. We would play Bridges, etc.<br>
<br>
In December 2014, me, Aber and Quazamaster would play UHC, Mineplex's new game. We were all noobs, but it was an exciting game. We would skybase and snowball people off the edge. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y78shmuyAg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Vd79jYK8I<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Me, Aber and Redcamle would post about each other on sterling's wall. Sterling decided to network ban Redcamle. However, he also network banned me for "staff disrespect" and posted a comment on my wall, which was extremely rare (wow mp owners comment on my wall). This is the only picture i have of it.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7FJSe7o.png" /><br>
<br>
After a day, sterling decided to unban me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
During Jan-Feb 2015, me and Quaza would play UHC all the time.<br>
<br>
In February 2015, while me and Quaza were playing UHC, we fought a moderator (KOSIUS) and won, and he rage-banned us for “killaura”. I uploaded the video to YouTube and I was instantly unbanned and he got demoted - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ssXworaI-8 . This resulted in his wall getting spammed with “congratulations”:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sqGvS81.png" /><br>
<br>
Shortly after, Dctr_ randomly network banned me for "Community Disruption", even though I did nothing wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In mid 2015, there started to be a lot of drama on Enjin. Users such as Nascarboy would post about various things like Underscore, Mineplex's corruption, etc. He also created Nasclub, an enjin site which later turned into a "debating forum" (cringe). It would attract weird users such as GoldRusherz, Lionlesslily, Tqcheung (or whatever) and Fyte. Other users such as Intergalautism (IntergalacticJC) would organize riots in mineplex lobbies, while maewtt would spend hours creating false reports on others (he was another Nasclub specimen).<br>
<br>
There was also a user called Trix2806, she was a girl from Denmark who seemed to be mentally retarded because she couldn’t write coherent sentences:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B1BzZ7A.png" /><br>
<br>
After 3 weeks, she posted this, saying that she travelled to another country to meet up with her Minecraft boyfriend (Jyystin1337):<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XufkdcS.png" /><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In July 2015, FlyingSquid decided to create a skype group called "Forum friends", so we could all talk in one place. <br>
<br>
This is the beginning of TC.<br>
<br>
Right away, we added Mineplex admins, and two of them actually wrote messages in the chat (Chiss and Dctr_). <br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sGnxW4Z.png" /><br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ohBI1Yp.png" /><br>
<br>
After a few days I took over it, removed some people and added others, and called it Team Corruptr. The name was inspired by Nascarboy calling Dctr "Corruptr". <br>
<br>
Also during that time Lysp bought an "alt generator” (which worked) and shared it with me. We would go to lobbies and spam Dctr with insults until he banned us. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m8FlnwTQ7E<br>
<br>
<br>
Also around this time, Lysp’s ban appeal got leaked (he sent it to Falco and he posted it instead of submitting to appeals). It’s now known as the “Daniel 14 Years Old United Kingdom” pasta, and it used to be spammed everywhere on enjin. Lysp left Enjin shortly after that, because almost all his posts were being spammed with the appeal.<br>
<br>
Here it is in full:<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
In late 2015, Aber found a Mineplex user called CloudyBogdan. He seemed to be mentally retarded, and he uploaded some of the cringiest videos on the entire internet. <br>
<br>

We have a YouTube playlist with videos about him:<br>

<br>
<b>The Staff Hacks</b><br>
<br>
In October 2015, someone discovered that Minecraft stores session IDs in the logs file, every time you start the game. That means, if someone sends you their log file, you could log into their account.<br>
<br>
Because of the time zone differences it was hard to set up, but we managed to get Necrai and Mj to message every moderator and try to convince them into sending their logs.<br>
<br>
Guess what? A moderator did send their log file. Necrai and Mj unbanned a few network banned people, etc, then we casually went and played bridges from my freshly unbanned account, as if nothing happened.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YKTMHwT.png" /><br>
<br>
<br>
https://youtu.be/_EK6G08Ikxs<br>
<br>
<br>
But then I realized that I missed out. So guess what - they did it again, but this time, I told them to call me if they get the account to wake me up (yes, I know, priorities).<br>
<br>
And, at 5 AM, I woke up to a skype call sound. My heart was beating incredibly fast and I was shaking, I still couldn’t believe it. <br>
<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoQzbf2MuSg<br>
<br>
After 20 minutes, the account got banned, and I went back to sleep. It still felt surreal, I thought it was a dream. <br>
<br>
After I woke up and I went to school, I browsed enjin/mineplex right away on my phone. The whole site knew about it, and Chiss even made a forum thread explaining the situation, but there was a problem. They found out that Necrai and Mj did it, so they network banned them. I felt pretty shitty because I knew I caused it, but the reason they got found out was that Carnlval (another Mineplex user) was in a skype call with Necrai and Mj while they were banning people on the account. Aaand he just decided to expose them. Talk about a good friend.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T4L09Ip.png" /><br>

<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XG0SZBK.png" /><br>
<br>
After this, Chiss (Mineplex owner) added Mj on Skype and started messaging him. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X673V76.png" /><br>
<br>
<br>
Right after this, Necrai, Mj and Carnlval had their Enjin accounts permanently deleted, at the request of Chiss, even though this had nothing to do with Enjin.<br>
<br>
<b>But this... was only the beginning :)</b><br>
<br>
<br>
In December 2015, I decided to add two new members to TC, Dekomori and Mj (Matt). Aber started freaking out randomly and insulting Dekomori, and he "left/got kicked" from TC. <br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Rf6Yvn0.png" /><br>
<br>
Right after that, in January 2016, Aber threatened to “leak my IRL” which he apparently obtained via waybackmachine.<br>
<br>
After messaging one of Aber's friends, they agreed to send me Aber's IRL so I can leak it just in case he leaks mine. He then posted a blurry picture of me from when I was 13 on Enjin.<br>
<br>
And I fired back with his IRL.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wja6euR.png" /><br>
<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B679uvW.png" /><br>
<br>
<br>
However, he calmly denied it was him and even I didn't believe it was him. There was no way to prove it, either. (it was later confirmed legitimate)<br>
<br>
Various people left Enjin because they were “shocked” by the IRL leaking, and even two TC members “ghosted” the group.<br>
<br>
At this point, TC was in shambles after Aber's betrayal and IRL leaking. The skype group was dead.<br>
<br>
Also around this time, Team Nameless (which Necrai and Mj were part of) were playing clans, they griefed with jungle trees and they were also part of another hilarious video where 3 clans got blacklisted for spamming a 10 second countdown in chat:<br>

<br>
<br>
Around June 2016, things were “warming up” again. Wyatt would message me on Steam to talk about Aber. He managed to dox Aber and posted pictures of him, his family, his house and even his parents’ wedding. He also started ordering pizzas and other food to his address. He also emailed Aber’s school with his “bully” enjin posts, which ended up in him getting suspended and grounded for a month :<br>
<br>

<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NX17xKV.png" /><br>
<br>
<br>
Wyatt then said he was going to call in a b .0-mb threat to Aber’s school, but I stopped him because that would have ended up with him getting arrested. Side note - if you do that you WILL get caught, it’s just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
In September 2016, I added Clau_ and Nick (Herobrine) to TC. Right away, we had a “falling out” with Rebel_Guy, a Mineplex youtuber, where he got his retarded fans to spam us. Rebel_Guy made a 15 minute video about us and got his retarded fans to spam us with comments and dislikes. Quaza then made a 17 minute masterpiece response video to him, which shut him up:<br>
<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNMB5zibGXA<br>
<br>
Also around the same time, Wyatt received an email from someone who claimed to be Aber’s dad, claiming that he “filed a police report” against him and that “he documented every food delivery.<br>
At the end, he signed with “Austins’s dad”.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
On 30 October 2016 (Halloween), a user named openclosed published a Google Doc with over 100 Enjin IRL pictures he collected over the years. After 2 hours, we figured out that Mechanic was behind the account, and <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Reunion</b><br>
<br>
By May 2017, TC was dead and Minecraft/Mineplex died out. So, I decided to do the unthinkable.<br>
<br>
On 25 May 2017, I decided to switch to Discord, and re-add old members who were previously kicked, and add new members as well.<br>
<br>
And thus, TC was revived.<br>
<br>
One of the new members was a person who was interested in hacking. Less than a few days later, The June Jackings began.<br>

While all of this was happening, Endercat (another dumb Enjin user) told us to stop because he has “some info about us that we wouldn’t like to be shared”. Except.. the folder was empty (the icon shows if it has files in it or not)<br>

Squid used to post about us 24/7 and annoying us, so we decided to “do anything it takes to make him stop”.<br>

So, we obtained this:<br>
